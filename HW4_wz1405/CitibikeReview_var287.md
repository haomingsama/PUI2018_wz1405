# Citibike Review
## Author: Vivaldi Rinaldi (var287)


#### Hypothesis: 
The idea is good and interesting, you could expand more by adding temporal aspect to make it a little bit more intersting. The wording of the hypothesis better to be more clear. 

For example, the **Null** could be: *Men and Women have equal average trip duration while riding CitiBike at night.*

**Alternative** could be: *Men and Women have different average trip duration while riding CitiBike at night.*

H0: Men‘s mean = Women's mean 

H1: Men‘s mean != Women's mean

#### Data
you can separate the dataset into Men and Women, Just to make it easy for your analysis.

#### Test
I will recommend 2 tail T-test based on your hypothesis.

#1 Description

    From the very first assignment, I performed all the commands on my Mac's terminal. Firstly, I create a directory called PUI2018 under the Users. Then, with 'export VARNAME="<var end point>"' command, I saved the folder temporarily. Next, as indicated by the first assignment, I opened Mac's bash_profile to export again for saving it permanently and created the alias pui2018 = PUI2018 so that I can call the directory quickly and easily next time I want to do so. Finally, I cd back to the general directory, typed'pwd' command to check the current directory, then tried 'pui2018' alias command and it successfully took me to the PUI2018 directory.
